#  With RRACEAsian we reject the Null Hypothesis and replace with the alternative Hypothesis.  In the

#  Also, we know based on the estimates and a positive number, the racial group RRACEAsian are 
#  very likely to be vaccinated.
#  If we were to look at RRACEBlack we find different results.  First we would reject the Null Hypothesis
#  and replace with the alternative Hypothesis.  Looking at the data out put we would also know that with
#  a .001 level significance.  However when see a different result when evaluating the Estimate.  Since
#  RRACEBlack returned a negative number we know that this racial group RRACEBlack is less likely to be vaxxed.
#  Yes they do have expected signs, if neg for example with RRACEBlack 
#  the value is negative which would mean the Racial group is less likely.  Where if we would intemperate the
#  positive value for RRRACEAsain we know they are more likely to be vaxxed.

###  In both examples we found that an Advance degree was significant.  The data points also show that there is no
###  signigicane with RRACEBlack.  When comparing some of the differences I found that Model_Probit 1 's estimated
###  were closer to 0 than that of the logistic model.
